🛒 Magic A – A Fun Little Virtual Store in C
Magic A is a simple console program written in C that lets users explore a virtual store with different aisles. Whether you're craving groceries, browsing for furniture, or in need of medicine, this project gives you a playful experience of picking products, entering quantities, and seeing your total — all from the terminal.

👀 What It Does:
Greets you with a warm welcome message.

Lets you choose between 3 aisles: Grocery, Hardware/Furniture, or Medicines.

In the Grocery aisle, you can browse categories like:

Instant & Packaged Foods

Bakery & Breads

Snacks & Sweets

You can pick items, input how many you want, and see the total price.

You’ll also be asked if you want to continue shopping or leave the store.

🛠️ Why I Made This:
This project helped me practice the basics of C programming — like functions, conditionals, loops, and user input. It’s a great stepping stone for anyone learning how to structure a C program with real-world logic.


PS: if you have any idea about changing the code feel free to tell me, thanks!
